# JS-game
A JS game similar to the T-rex game made following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ" target="_blank">video</a> by KnifeCircus

<ul>
To make the game different from KnifeCircus we have also 
  <li>implemented a score feature which increases everytime the user jumps over the block </li>
  <li> allowed the user to to click, press w, up arrowkey or spacebar to jump </li>
  <li>changed the alert to show the score when the game ends</li>
